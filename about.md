**Why build a chatbot?**

You can think of a chatbot as a conversational user interface that can be
deployed in any application, and integrated with numerous third party platforms
and services (like Twilio, Twitter, Facebook, Firebase, Skype, and Slack).
Chatbots can be simple programs that obey and execute natural language or other
commands, e.g. Turn off the lights, or more sophisticated virtual characters
that engage the end-user via entertaining dialog or other interactive content.
